# Age Calculator

Project design inspired by the book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" by Oliver Burkeman.

The UI takes birthday input from the user and calculates the age in years, months, and days.  Then it converts the age to approximate number of weeks. 
A bar chart shows the user's age compared to 80, 60, 40 and 20 weeks.
